# The Five Steps to Starting a Career as a Business Analyst:

## Decide Your Goal:

The most important criterion for success in other professions, including business analysis, is to master the foundations. You may begin by studying the core ideas of business analytics. First and foremost, you should understand what a business analyst performs. You may choose whether or not to learn business analytics through blogs and online courses..
 

## Take a course:
Taking a course such ECBA certification, or an online bootcamp is always helpful for starting an entry level job. If you're competing against applicants who all have a bachelor's degree, an additional course that teaches you a particular skill or provides you hands-on experience with capstone projects will help you stand out.


## Create a Portfolio
When seeking to secure a job as a business analyst, a portfolio may be really helpful. It demonstrates your ability to manage a project from start to finish, from problem identification through data and business analysis. The nice part about a portfolio is that you can create one even if you are not already employed as a BA.

## Acquire Work Experience
You can start by volunteering with a small business or doing an internship. Once recruited as an entry-level business analyst, get experience by working on as many different types of projects as possible.
If you are already employed by a company in another position, there are numerous transferable skills to working as a business analyst. You can enter the area with expertise of a specific business domain or industry knowledge in general.

## Expand your network
Business analyst employment openings are commonly spread by word-of-mouth, and many BAs have made lateral career transfers as a result of the relationship-building they've done inside their companies, their strong communication skills, and their interest in their company's business side. Developing good relationships with industry mentors and peers may also assist you in navigating the workforce, facilitating introductions to individuals who may be recruiting, and informing you of BA possibilities that are typically not published.

When developing your BA talents, be sure to also develop a large network of people who can help you on your way to a BA profession.
