# What is user story

A user story is a brief, simple statement that represents a feature or requirement from the user's perspective. User stories are used to describe what a user needs to accomplish a specific task, and they help the development team understand the end-user's needs.

A user story is a concise, simple, and easy-to-understand description of a feature or functionality that a user requires to achieve a specific goal. It is typically written in the form of "As a (user), I want (goal) so that (reason)." User stories are used to define the requirements of a product or feature in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders.


User stories are often written in a specific format and have acceptance criteria that need to be met for the story to be considered done.

# What is Epic?

On the other hand, is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories. Epics are used to represent larger features or functionalities that cannot be easily captured in a single user story.


Epics are used to describe a significant feature or requirement that can't be completed within a single iteration. 


# Difference between User Stories and Epics

User stories and epics are different in terms of scope and level of detail. User stories are focused on a single feature or functionality, while epics represent larger features or functionalities that require multiple user stories to fully define. User stories are typically written in a single sentence, while epics may require multiple sentences to fully describe the feature or functionality.

# Relationship between User Stories and Epics

User stories and epics are interconnected, and they have a hierarchical relationship. 

Epics represent large, overarching themes or requirements that are broken down into smaller user stories that can be completed within an iteration. 

User stories are used to represent a single feature or requirement that can be completed within an iteration.

# Writing User Stories

## Importance of SMART framework

To ensure that user stories are well-written and concise, the SMART framework is often used. The SMART framework ensures that user stories are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. By using the SMART framework, user stories are more likely to be completed within the iteration and meet the customer's needs.

## Steps to Write SMART User Stories

- Define the user: 
Identify the user or persona that the user story will represent.
- Define the feature: 
Identify the feature or requirement that the user story will describe.
- Write the user story: 
Write a brief, simple statement that describes the feature or requirement from the user's perspective. Use the SMART framework to ensure that the user story is well-written.
- Add acceptance criteria: 
Define the acceptance criteria that need to be met for the user story to be considered done.

- Make it specific: 
Ensure that the user story is specific and focuses on a single feature or functionality.

- Make it measurable: 
Ensure that the user story can be measured to determine if it has been achieved.

- Make it achievable: 
Ensure that the user story is achievable and can be completed within a reasonable timeframe.

- Make it relevant: 
Ensure that the user story is relevant to the project and will contribute to the overall goal.

- Make it time-bound: 
Ensure that the user story has a clear deadline for completion.


## Examples of SMART User Stories

Let's take a look at some examples of SMART user stories:

- As a customer, I want to be able to view my order history, so I can track my purchases.

- As a website visitor, I want to be able to search for products by name or category, so I can quickly find what I'm looking for.

- As a salesperson, I want to be able to view my sales metrics, so I can track my progress towards my goals.

## How to set acceptance criteria to user stories with an example

Acceptance criteria define the conditions that need to be met for a user story to be considered done. Acceptance criteria are often written in a specific format and are used to ensure that the development team and the customer have a shared understanding of what needs to be done.

Let's take a look at an example of acceptance criteria for the user story "As a customer, I want to be able to view my order history, so I can track my purchases":

- The user should be able to view all their previous orders.
- The user should be able to filter their orders by date, status, or product.
- The user should be able to view detailed information about each order, including the products ordered and the shipping information.

## Best Practices for Writing User Stories

- Keep it simple and concise.
- Focus on the user's needs and goals.
- Avoid using technical jargon or complex language.
- Prioritize user stories based on business value and risk.
- Write user stories from the user's perspective.
- Use the SMART framework to ensure that user stories are well-written and concise.
- Collaborate with the customer to ensure that user stories meet their needs.
- Write acceptance criteria to ensure that the development team and the customer have a shared understanding of what needs to be done.
- Refine user stories during sprint planning and backlog grooming.


# Steps to Writing SMART Epics

- Identify the high-level requirement or feature that the epic will represent.
- Break down the epic into smaller user stories that can be completed within an iteration.
- Write user stories using the SMART framework.
- Define acceptance criteria for each user story.
- Prioritize user stories based on business value and risk.

# Guide to Map User Stories with Epics
Mapping user stories with epics is an essential part of Agile development. By breaking down epics into smaller user stories, the development team can work on features and requirements iteratively and incrementally.

Let's take a look at an example of mapping user stories with epics:

- Epic:
As a customer, I want to be able to purchase products online, so I can easily buy what I need.

- User Stories:

    - As a customer, I want to be able to add products to my cart, so I can purchase multiple items at once.
    - As a customer, I want to be able to view my cart, so I can see the items I have selected.
    - As a customer, I want to be able to enter my billing and shipping information, so I can complete my purchase.
    - As a customer, I want to be able to review my order before finalizing the purchase, so I can make any necessary changes.

By breaking down the epic into smaller user stories, the development team can focus on one feature or requirement at a time and deliver business value iteratively and incrementally.

# Tools for Writing User Stories and Epics

There are many tools available for writing user stories and epics. Some popular tools include Jira, Trello, MS Excel, Google Sheet, and MS Word. Jira is a project management tool that allows teams to track and manage their work using Agile methodologies. Trello is a visual collaboration tool that allows teams to organize and prioritize their work using Kanban boards. MS Word is a popular word processing tool that can be used to write and format user stories and epics.


In conclusion, writing SMART user stories and epics is an essential part of Agile development. By focusing on the user's needs and using the SMART framework, user stories are more likely to be completed within the iteration and meet the customer's needs. By breaking down epics into smaller user stories and prioritizing them based on business value and risk, the development team can deliver business value iteratively and incrementally.
