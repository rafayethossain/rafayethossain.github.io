## Core Concepts

These are the fundamental ideas that form the basis of software testing.

| Term | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Bug** | An error, flaw, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. | Clicking the "Save" button erases the user's input instead of saving it. |
| **Defect** | A variance between the expected and actual result. It is a flaw in the software that can cause it to fail to perform its required function. | The login page is missing a password field. |
| **Error** | A mistake made by a human, such as a developer or a business analyst, that results in a defect in the software. | A developer misinterprets a requirement and codes a feature incorrectly. |
| **Failure** | The inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements. | The application crashes when a user tries to upload a file. |
| **Fault** | An incorrect step, process, or data definition in a computer program. | A developer writes a line of code that attempts to divide by zero. |
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | A set of activities for ensuring quality in software engineering processes. QA focuses on improving the development process to prevent defects from occurring in the first place. | Implementing a new coding standard to reduce the number of bugs. |
| **Quality Control (QC)** | A set of activities for ensuring quality in software products. QC focuses on identifying defects in the finished product. | Performing a series of tests to find bugs before the software is released. |
| **Software Testing** | The process of evaluating a software application to find and fix defects before it goes to live users. | Executing a test case to verify that the login functionality is working correctly. |

## Testing Levels

Testing is typically performed at different levels throughout the software development lifecycle.

| Term | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit Testing** | A level of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. | A developer tests a single function to ensure that it is working correctly. |
| **Integration Testing** | A level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. | A tester verifies that the login module is working correctly with the user management module. |
| **System Testing** | A level of software testing where a complete and integrated software is tested. | A tester verifies that the entire system is working correctly, from the user interface to the database. |
| **Acceptance Testing** | A level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery. | A client tests the software to ensure that it meets their needs before they sign off on the project. |

## Testing Types

There are many different types of testing, each with a specific purpose.

| Term | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Ad-hoc Testing** | A type of testing that is performed without a plan or documentation. The goal of ad-hoc testing is to find bugs that may not be found by other types of testing. | A tester randomly clicks on links and buttons to see if they can break the application. |
| **Alpha Testing** | A type of acceptance testing that is performed by a team of testers who are internal to the organization. | A team of QA engineers tests the software before it is released to the public. |
| **Beta Testing** | A type of acceptance testing that is performed by a limited number of end-users before the software is released to the public. | A group of beta testers uses the software and provides feedback to the development team. |
| **Black-box Testing** | A method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. | A tester verifies that the login functionality is working correctly without knowing how the code is written. |
| **End-to-End Testing** | A methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. | A tester simulates a user journey, from creating an account to making a purchase. |
| **Exploratory Testing** | A type of testing where the tester is free to explore the application and look for bugs. | A tester uses their creativity and intuition to find bugs that may not be found by other types of testing. |
| **Functional Testing** | A type of testing that verifies that the software is working according to the specified requirements. | A tester verifies that the login functionality is working correctly. |
| **Non-functional Testing** | A type of testing that verifies that the software is working according to the specified non-functional requirements, such as performance, usability, and security. | A tester verifies that the application can handle a large number of users without crashing. |
| **Performance Testing** | A type of non-functional testing that is performed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. | A tester verifies that the application can handle a large number of users without crashing. |
| **Regression Testing** | A type of testing that is performed to ensure that a change to the software has not adversely affected existing features. | A tester re-runs all the existing test cases after a new feature is added to the software. |
| **Security Testing** | A type of testing that is performed to identify vulnerabilities in the software and to ensure that the data and resources are protected from unauthorized access. | A tester tries to hack into the system to see if they can gain access to sensitive data. |
| **Smoke Testing** | A type of testing that is performed to verify that the critical functionalities of the software are working correctly. | A tester performs a quick check of the main features of the software after a new build is deployed. |
| **Usability Testing** | A type of non-functional testing that is performed to determine how easy it is for users to use the software. | A group of users is asked to perform a series of tasks in the software, and their feedback is collected. |
| **White-box Testing** | A method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality. | A developer examines the code to ensure that it is working correctly. |

## Test Artifacts

These are the documents and other items that are created during the testing process.

| Term | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Bug Report** | A document that describes a bug that was found during testing. | A tester creates a bug report with a detailed description of the bug, including steps to reproduce it. |
| **Test Case** | A set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly. | A tester creates a test case to verify that the login functionality is working correctly. |
| **Test Plan** | A document that describes the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities. | A test manager creates a test plan that outlines the entire testing process for a new project. |
| **Test Strategy** | A high-level document that defines the testing approach for a project. | A test architect creates a test strategy that defines the overall testing approach for a new product. |
| **Traceability Matrix** | A document that traces the requirements from the requirements specification to the test cases. | A business analyst creates a traceability matrix to ensure that all the requirements have been tested. |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What is the difference between a bug, a defect, and an error?**

A: An error is a mistake made by a human, which results in a defect in the software. A bug is a type of defect that causes the software to produce an incorrect or unexpected result.

**Q: What is the difference between QA and QC?**

A: QA is a proactive process that focuses on preventing defects, while QC is a reactive process that focuses on identifying defects.

**Q: What is the difference between black-box testing and white-box testing?**

A: Black-box testing is a method of testing where the tester does not have any knowledge of the internal workings of the software. White-box testing is a method of testing where the tester has full knowledge of the internal workings of the software.
