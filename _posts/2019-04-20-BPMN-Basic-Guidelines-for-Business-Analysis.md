# What is BPMN?

BPMN, which stands for Business Process Model and Notation, is a graphical notation used to model and represent business processes and workflows. It provides a standardized and visual language for describing complex processes in a clear and understandable manner.

BPMN utilizes a flowchart-based modeling approach, where processes are depicted as a series of interconnected activities or actions. These activities are organized within swimming lanes, representing different participants or performers involved in the process.

The development of BPMN began in 2004 by the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI). In 2005, BPMI collaborated with the Object Management Group (OMG) to further refine and standardize the notation. Since then, BPMN has become widely adopted in the business process management field as a universal language for process modeling and documentation.

# Why is BPMN important?

BPMN is important because it helps you:

## Visualize complex processes:

With BPMN, you can create diagrams that represent your organization's processes and workflows in a way that's easy to understand.

## Identify areas for improvement:

By analyzing your BPMN diagrams, you can identify areas where processes can be streamlined or improved.

## Communicate more effectively:

BPMN provides a common language for communicating about business processes and workflows, which can help reduce confusion and improve collaboration.

Everyone from business analysts to developers to company managers may "speak the same language" and confidently adjust to changing conditions.

# Benefits of Using BPMN:

- All stakeholders can understand how a process works
- IT and business analysts can work together on a consistent, accurate process design
- Everyone can understand how a technical process lives within the bigger business picture

BPMN Allow you to GAP Analysis during requirement analysis and model :

1.  Current state: “as-is”
2.  Future state: “to-be”

# Basic Elements of BPMN:

By understanding the fundamental elements of BPMN, you'll gain insights into how processes are represented and analyzed in this powerful framework

## Tasks:

Represented by rectangles, tasks are the fundamental building blocks of a process. They represent the activities or work steps that need to be performed.

## Events:

Represented by circles, events mark significant points in a process. They can be the start or end points, triggers for activities, or indications of external occurrences.

## Gateways:

Represented by diamonds, gateways define decision points or branching in a process. They control the flow of the process based on conditions or rules.

## Flows:

Arrows connecting the elements, flows depict the sequence and direction of activities within a process. They show how information or control moves between different elements.

## Artifacts:

Represented by dashed rectangles, artifacts provide additional information about a process. They include data objects, groups, annotations, and other supporting documentation.

## Pools and Lanes:

Pools represent separate organizations or entities involved in a process, while lanes represent divisions or roles within an organization. They help to visualize responsibilities and ownership.

# Brief on BPMN Components:

## Activity:

A BPMN Activity is simply "Work" that a company or organization performs in a business process. An Activity is can be atomic (Tasks) or decomposable (Sub-Processes). There are basically three BPMN activity types:

    1. BPMN Task
    2. BPMN Sub-Process
    3. BPMN Call Activity

A BPMN task is an atomic activity within a process flow. You create a task when the activity cannot be broken down to a finer level of detail. Generally, a person or applications will perform the task when it is executed.

In BPMN 2.0, there are different types of tasks identified for use in representing more specific behavior that tasks might represent. Here is a list of BPMN 2.0 task type:

- Service Task
- Send Task
- Receive Task
- User Task
- Manual Task
- Business Rule Task
- Script Task

## Service Task

A Service Task is a Task that uses a Web service, an automated application, or other kinds of service in completing the task.

## Send Task

A Send Task is represents a task that sends a Message to another pool. The Task is completed once the Message has been sent.

## Receive Task

A Receive Task indicates that the process has to wait for a message to arrive in order to continue. The Task is completed once the message has received.

## User Task

A User Task represents that a human performer performs the Task with the use of a software application.

## Manual Task

A Manual Task is a Task that is performed without the aid of any business process execution engine or any application.

## Business Rule Task

Business Rule Task is newly added in BPMN 2.0. It provides a mechanism for a process to provide input to a Business Rules Engine and then obtain the output provided by the Business Rules Engine.

## Script Task

A Script Task is executed by a business process engine. The task defines a script that the engine can interpret. When the task begin, the engine will execute the script. The Task will be completed when the script is completed.

## BPMN Sub-Processes

In BPMN, a sub-process is a compound activity that represents a collection of other tasks and sub-processes. Generally, we create BPMN diagrams to communicate processes with others. To facilitate effective communications, we really do not want to make a business process diagram too complex. By using sub-processes, you can split a complex process into multiple levels, which allows you to focus on a particular area in a single process diagram.

## Loop

A Sub-Process with Multi-Instance marker indicates that the sub-process can run with other identical sub-processes simultaneously.

## BPMN Call Activities

A BPMN Call Activity references an Activity defined in a process that is external to the current process definition. It allows you to create a reusable process definition that can be reused in multiple other process definitions.

# Exploring Different BPMN Models:

BPMN provides a standardized visual language for modeling business processes, enabling organizations to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and drive business success. Let's delve into the key BPMN models and their applications.

1. Process Flow Diagram:
   The Process Flow Diagram is the most basic BPMN model, representing the flow of activities and tasks within a process. It uses symbols such as rectangles for activities, arrows for sequence flows, and diamonds for decision points. This model provides a high-level overview of the process flow and helps identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

1. Collaboration Diagram:
   The Collaboration Diagram focuses on the interactions between multiple participants or organizations within a process. It visualizes the message exchanges, information flows, and responsibilities between different entities. This model is useful for understanding how different parties collaborate and communicate during a process.

1. Choreography Diagram:
   The Choreography Diagram illustrates the interactions and communication between multiple participants without specifying the internal processes of each participant. It shows the sequence of messages exchanged between participants and highlights the responsibilities and agreements between them. This model is valuable when modeling complex interactions among different entities.

1. Swimlane Diagram:
   The Swimlane Diagram divides the process into lanes, representing different roles, departments, or organizational units. It clarifies the responsibilities and handoffs between various stakeholders. This model helps identify process ownership, accountability, and potential areas for improvement within specific lanes.

BPMN offers various models to visualize and analyze business processes, each with its unique focus and applications. By understanding these BPMN models, organizations can effectively model and optimize their processes, leading to improved efficiency, streamlined operations, and better decision-making. Explore the different BPMN models to gain a comprehensive understanding of your processes and drive business success.
