# What is test documentation?

All files containing information on the testing team's strategy, progress, metrics, and outcomes are included in the test documentation. Existing data is combined to monitor test effort, control test coverage, and track future project requirements.

# Types of test documentation

In general, Test Documentation serves two functions. For starters, it offers testers with trustworthy data for test preparation and execution. Second, it offers project stakeholders with up-to-date information (Designer, Development Team, Marketing, Product Owner). The test documentation comprises of both internal and external files to suit these two primary functions.

# What are the objectives and purposes of software testing documentation?

QA documentation gathers data on test design, execution, responsible team members, metrics, and results. It provides a comprehensive view of the project and delivers numerous practical benefits.

Removes uncertainty from test activities - Testing documentation includes complete specifications of all scheduled tests, making it simple for team members and Product Owners to keep track of the product.

Aids in the setup of a testing environment by storing test documents, used hardware, automation tools, framework data, and a detailed description of product performance. This information may be reused by the Testing Team in the future or passed on to new members.
Provides stakeholders with more information about the testing process.

Documentation aids in the evaluation of test effectiveness.
Most significantly, software testing documentation allows product owners and managers to reuse the most successful methods while saving time and money by eliminating those that do not satisfy the KPI. It is a long-term investment that enhances current test outcomes while also being reusable for future test assignments.
