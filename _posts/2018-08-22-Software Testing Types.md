Nowadays, anyone can name hundreds of different types of software testing. Of course, they all have the right to exist and work. Each type of testing technique that you use to thoroughly verify software or applications serves a specific purpose.


It is not essential to comprehend the definitions of all testing types. However, we will learn about some of the most commonly used testing types in this section.

# Functional testing

The purpose of functional testing is to ensure that the application and all of its functions work correctly in accordance with the business requirements and meet the software specifications. Its primary function is to ensure that the output of each application function matches the expectation.

# Non-Functional Testing

It is the reverse of functional testing in that it tests non-functional parameters such as software reliability, load testing, performance, and accountability. Non-functional testing is just as important as functional testing because it affects customer satisfaction.

Non-functional testing, for example, would examine how many people can work on any software at the same time.



# Ad-hoc testing

This style of software testing is completely unstructured and informal. There is no need for a test case or a test document to handle this. Without any reference, tests can be run on any stakeholder.
Ad-hoc testing is typically performed by persons who are familiar with the domain and process of the software application. This test can uncover all of the problems in the software that would otherwise go undetected if test cases were used.

# Exploratory testing

Exploratory testing is an unwritten testing method that emphasizes the tester's independence and creativity. This is a hands-on technique in which the tester participates in the implementation rather than the test plan.

During and after the software development process, exploratory testing is done to uncover unknown problems. This type of test, in particular, may be used by the tester to detect specific flaws, providing insight on the design of future functional and regression tests.

# Regression testing

When a program is modified, the old things continue to function properly alongside the new modifications shown by the regression test. All of the old capabilities are still in place before the introduction of a new edition of a software product to ensure that the old test cases are executed in the new version. 

The reason for performing this test is that modifying the code or connecting might easily produce faults in the software and cause the work to be interrupted.

# System testing

System testing is the practice of deploying software in various contexts (for example, operating systems) to ensure that it functions properly. Complete system implementation and environment testing is done. It falls within the category of black box testing.
Functional and non-functional testing are the two forms of testing.

# Acceptance testing

Customers frequently go through acceptance testing to confirm that the software solution fulfills their needs and expectations. It falls under the category of black-box testing.This type of test is typically undertaken to ensure that the system satisfies the needs of the customer.

Alpha and beta testing are two other types of testing that have gained popularity in recent years.

# Alpha Testing

This is a sort of acceptance testing performed prior to the product being released to the consumer. QA tests are often performed by a team, whereas software testing is performed internally within the firm.

# Beta testing

The end-user, a team outside of development, or a pre-released version of a product known as a beta version perform beta testing. The purpose of beta testing is to identify and correct unanticipated faults. It falls under the category of black-box testing. When software testing is performed for a small group of people.

All tests can be further classified into two types. That is both positive and negative testing.
Only good aspects are considered in a positive testing method, that is, whether the system is accomplishing what it is designed to do.
Negative testing accomplishes the inverse of what the system should not do.

# Positive Testing

It is yet another important testing approach used to demonstrate a software product or application under test. It validates how the application performs with the positive data set. In this sort of testing, the valid data set will be entered as the input value.


# Negetive Testing

It is an unique type of software testing approach used to assess the system's resilience to unexpected events. It is extremely important in high-performance software development.

The system is allowed in this testing by providing invalid data as input. A negative test determines if an application operates predictably when given negative inputs.

# Black-box testing

Black box testing is a test technique that focuses on the output rather than on the internal processes of the system. This is also referred to as functional testing.

# White box testing

White box testing takes into account the internal processes of a system. This is also known as structural testing or glass box testing.

# Grey Box Testing

Grey box testing is a software testing method that involves testing a software application with only a partial knowledge of its internal working structure. It is a hybrid of black box and white box testing because it involves access to internal coding to design test cases as white box testing and testing practices at the functionality level as black box testing.
