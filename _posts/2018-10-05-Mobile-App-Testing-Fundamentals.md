Today, the tide of protectionist feeling is sweeping the country. Someone could be talking with his buddies, checking the weather forecast before leaving the house, or sitting at home ordering dinner. Someone is once again perusing through Facebook unnecessarily. People use mobile gadgets from the moment they wake up until they go to bed.

The rise of mobile applications and mobile devices in recent years has necessitated the necessity for mobile testing. Currently, not all of these organizations are developing mobile applications, but 84% plan to do so in the near future.
According to one survey, 50 percent of mobile applications are used only once after downloading, and if a user experiences a glitch only once, more than half of users erase the application from their mobile device.

This demonstrates how critical mobile testing is to the success of any firm. Because of the differences in operating systems (iOS and Android), screen size, and resolution, mobile application development and testing are much more difficult.

We use our phones in various places. We have high-speed Wi-Fi at home. when walking, on 4G, 3G, and occasionally when there is no internet connection To deal with issues, we should always consider the most effective technique to test the application. Let's look at some of the greatest mobile application testing practices:

Testing on real devices is one of the recommended practices for mobile application testing. The usage of emulators and simulators is beneficial in the early phases of development. The application must be tested on a real device so that the tester may be confident that the test findings are accurate. Testing on real devices also provides the tester with a better understanding of overall usability.

Before testing, make sure your gadget and operating system are in good working order. On the market, there are thousands of Android devices and hundreds of iOS devices. When testing your company's application, use the device that the majority of your consumers use. For instance, iPhone 8, iOS 10.1.


If you are unsure which device the customer is using, choose the most popular devices on the market. This information is freely accessible via Google search. There are other analytics programs available online, in addition to Google Analytics.


Always consider the edge scenarios. For example, if you are a phone user and use the app while strolling, you will most likely encounter slow internet rather than Wi-Fi when you are in the workplace. Examine your program for a sluggish internet connection.

Examine the battery consumption rate; power-hungry applications are more likely to be removed from devices. Examine how much battery your application uses. If you notice, "Hmm, this device is getting hot," report it as well. This could be an excellent place to start with the investigation. You can also monitor how much battery your phone is using by going into the settings.


Always check that your application supports horizontal mode, you can catch a lot of visual problems just by turning the phone 90 degrees!

## What are the types of mobile applications?

Always ensure that your application supports horizontal mode; rotating the phone 90 degrees can reveal a plethora of visual issues!

## What kinds of mobile applications are there?

App Stores, such as Google Play for Android and Apple's App Store, are used to install native software. Native applications are those that can be installed and run on your devices. Consider Facebook and WhatsApp.

Web applications, from mobile web browsers to Google Chrome, run web applications. Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, and other browsers use mobile networks or Wi-Fi. For instance, 
` www.nba.com ` and ` www.amazon.com.`

A hybrid application is a combination of a native application and a web application. They can run on devices or in the cloud and are built with web technologies such as HTML 5 and CSS. A great example of a hybrid application is eBay.

Nowadays, mobile testing is in high demand, thus knowing how to do mobile testing is always useful. You can have a lot of freelancing options as a mobile software tester. Many businesses use remote testers to test their applications.
