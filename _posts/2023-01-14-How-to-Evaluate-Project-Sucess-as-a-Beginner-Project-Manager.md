As a beginner project manager, it can be challenging to know how to evaluate the success of your projects. Without the right metrics, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that completing a project on time and within budget is all that matters. However, there are several other key factors to consider when measuring project success. In this blog post, we will discuss the five most important metrics to evaluate project success and provide examples to help you understand how to apply them.

# Project Completion
The first metric to consider when evaluating project success is project completion. This metric measures whether the project was delivered on time, within scope, and on budget. It's essential to define the project's scope and objectives clearly from the outset, so you can evaluate whether you achieved what you set out to do. For example, if your project was to launch a new website, did you launch it on time and within the budget allocated?

# Quality of Deliverables
The second metric to consider is the quality of the project deliverables. This metric measures the extent to which the deliverables meet the requirements of the project stakeholders. It's essential to define the quality standards for each deliverable, so you can measure how well you met those standards. For example, if your project was to develop a new software product, did the product meet the functional and non-functional requirements defined by the stakeholders?

# Stakeholder Satisfaction
The third metric to consider is stakeholder satisfaction. This metric measures the extent to which the stakeholders are satisfied with the project's outcome. It's essential to identify the key stakeholders and their expectations from the project from the outset, so you can measure their satisfaction accurately. For example, if your project was to implement a new customer relationship management system, did the sales team find the new system easy to use and efficient?

# Resource Utilization
The fourth metric to consider is resource utilization. This metric measures how efficiently the project resources were utilized. It's essential to track the resource usage throughout the project, so you can identify areas where improvements can be made. For example, if your project was to implement a new inventory management system, did you use the resources efficiently and effectively, or were there any areas of waste?

# Return on Investment (ROI)
The fifth and final metric to consider is the return on investment (ROI). This metric measures the financial benefit the project has delivered to the organization. It's essential to define the financial benefits of the project from the outset, so you can measure the ROI accurately. For example, if your project was to develop a new product line, did the new product line generate the expected revenue and profit margin?


Evaluating project success is essential to measure the project's performance and achievements. By using the five metrics outlined above, beginner project managers can accurately evaluate project success and identify areas for improvement. Remember, project success is not just about completing a project on time and within budget. It's about delivering high-quality project deliverables that meet the stakeholders' expectations, utilizing resources effectively and efficiently, and delivering financial benefits to the organization. With these metrics in mind, you can ensure your projects are a success, and your career as a project manager is on the right track.
