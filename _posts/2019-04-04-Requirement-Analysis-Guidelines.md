# Why Analyse Requirements?
You analyze to look for three things:

1. You want all stakeholders to understand the requirement.
2. You want the client to be able to grasp the need, function, and prioritize the demand.
3. You want your designer, developer, or team to create and construct a solution that meets the requirements.

The success or failure of a systems or software project is dependent on requirements analysis. The requirements should be documented, actionable, quantifiable, testable, traceable, tied to recognized business needs or opportunities, and stated to a degree of detail adequate for system design.


Taking your requirement and visual model to understand requirement by various levels of stakeholder.

Visual Modeling Concept

# What is Visual Modeling?

Visual modeling is a graphical representation of something **complex** using a modeling language that makes it **easier to understand**.

Let's take a step farther. So, first and foremost, visual modeling is a graphical representation. A picture is much easier to comprehend than a block of words. It might be a picture, a flow chart, or an excel file. **Graphical representation is a method of showing it rather than merely text.** 

There are several graphical representations that can be used with various modeling languages, and what they do is take something difficult and make it easy to grasp.

A visual model, for example, is an organizational chart. Everyone has seen an organizational chart that depicts the many levels and hierarchy of who reports to whom. Consider an org chart for a large business, which has all of these various levels and divisions, and who all reports to whom. Now consider it or chart it in text form.


I believe you have to clarify it in text to say something like, "You know, so and so is the president." Likewise, the vice president reports to the president and other vice presidents. It would take a long time to convey something in prose, but an organizational chart model demonstrates it extremely clearly and intuitively. That's the model.

## Benefits of Visual Modeling:

So what are the benefits of visual modeling? We've talked about a few of them already, you can easily understand complex information.

- Easily understand complex information
- Gets all stakeholders involved
- Receive requirements efficiently
- Identify the underlying problem
- Analyze ‘what if’ scenarios
- Allows remove of irrelevant information

## What is being modeled?

1.  Current state: “as-is”
2.  Future state: “to-be”

- Requirements to fill the gaps

# Business Models

## Organizational Chart :

This model will allow you to understand who is in charge, who reports to whom. No user very often in BA job.

## Competitive Comparison Matrix :

To Find out what service or product meet your need the most, a under used model. Used early on the project.

## Stakeholder Map :

To Category your stakeholder and where they fit.

## Use Case Diagram :

To identify who is going to use your system.

## Process Flow Diagram :

Commonly used model to showing you a process from start to finish. A unit level (extremely high level) view of a process.

    A) Unit Level
    B) Task Level

User Interface and Wireframe :
Design or mock up of a system.

## Technical Models

Mostly used by IT Business Analyst who is a Technical person.

1.  System Context Diagram
2.  Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
3.  CRUD Matrix
4.  State Diagram
5.  Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## BPMN Vs UML

BPMN stands for Business Process Modeling Notation. It is a graphical notation style; In other word, a visual language. BPMN is a flow chart based modeling language. It describes processes as flow of activities, or actions, arranged in swimming lanes, representing activity performers.

Basic Components:

1. Swimming Lane: Independent Process (Divider between processes)
2. Lane: Functionality or Activity within a Swimming Lane
3. Event: Mark start and end of a process.
4. Gateway: Control process flow, Can test a decision.
5. Activity: Process or Sub process. Naming convention should use verb and noun
6. Sequence Flow: A solid arrow that connects Event, Activity, and Gateway
