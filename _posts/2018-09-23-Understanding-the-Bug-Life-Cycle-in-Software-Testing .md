Software testing is an important aspect of software development as it helps ensure that the software is functioning as expected. One of the key elements of software testing is understanding the bug life cycle, also known as the defect life cycle. In this blog post, we will explore the various stages of the bug life cycle and how it affects software testing.

The bug life cycle is often referred to as the defect life cycle. It is Bug's (Software Bug) journey through many stages of it's existence. Suppose the software is governed by a testing procedure and is dependent on testing tools. This cycle varies by organization and project.

Let's have a look at the various stages of a bug's life cycle:

# New:

The first stage of the bug life cycle is the "New" stage. This is when a test engineer notices a mistake and marks it as "new." At this stage, the error is still being researched and approved, and it may be assigned, dropped, or deferred depending on the nature of the bug.

A new error may be assigned, dropped, or deferred.

# Assigned:

Once the bug has been posted, the test team leader confirms it and sends it to the development team. There are two possible scenarios at this stage: the bug can be directly traced to the developer, who is responsible for fixing it, or it can be allocated to the developer after being approved by the lead leadership.



# Open / Active:

Once the developer begins studying and repairing the bug, it enters the "Open/Active" stage. At this point, the developer begins to work on fixing the bug.


# Test / Fix:

When the developer replaces the relevant code and fixes the bug, the bug is marked as "Fixed." At this stage, the developer confirms the changes made to the code and the bug is ready for testing.


# Retest / Verify:

The "Retest/Verify" stage is when the tester reviews the changed code provided by the developer to ensure that the mistake has been fixed. Once the most recent build is installed in the test environment, the testing team knows that the bug is ready for testing.

# Reopen:

If the bug still exists after the developer has fixed it, the tester switches the status to "Reopen." The bug goes through its life cycle once more, starting from the Assigned stage.

# Deferred:

If the bug is not fixed immediately, it is marked as "Deferred," which means that it will be fixed in the future version. There are several reasons why bugs alter this scenario, including issue priority, a shortage of release time, and the influence on bug software.

# Dropped / Rejected:

If the developer believes that the bug is not logical or correct, they reject it, and the bug is marked as "Dropped/Rejected." This means that the bug will not be fixed.

# Duplicate:

If the developer believes that the bug is already fixed or is a duplicate of an existing bug, they mark it as "Duplicate."

# Closed:

The tester verifies that the bug has been rectified. If the tester believes that the bug is no longer present in the software, the tester "closes" the bug's status. This indicates that the bug has been resolved, tested, and approved.

# Not a bug / Enhancement:

If the application's functionality remains unchanged, it is marked as "Not a Bug/Enhancement." This means that the issue reported is not a bug but rather a minor tweak in the application's design.

In conclusion, understanding the bug life cycle is essential in software testing. It helps ensure that software defects are detected, reported, and resolved effectively. By following the various stages of the bug life cycle, software developers and testers can ensure that the software they produce is of high quality and free of bugs.
