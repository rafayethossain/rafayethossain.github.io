## The Key Differences Between a BA and a PM

While the roles of a Business Analyst and a Project Manager are closely related, they are not the same. Here are the key differences:

*   **Focus:** The BA is focused on the "what" and "why" of the project, while the PM is focused on the "how" and "when."
*   **Responsibilities:** The BA is responsible for gathering and documenting requirements, while the PM is responsible for planning, executing, and closing the project.
*   **Skills:** The BA needs strong analytical and communication skills, while the PM needs strong organizational and leadership skills.

For more on the BA role, see our [Introduction to Business Analysis](/introduction-to-business-analysis/).

## A Day in the Life of a Project Manager

So, what does a Project Manager actually do all day? Here's a glimpse into a typical day:

*   **Morning:** Start the day with a stand-up meeting with the project team to discuss progress and any roadblocks. Then, meet with stakeholders to provide a status update and manage their expectations.
*   **Afternoon:** Spend time updating the project plan, tracking the budget, and managing risks. You might also have a meeting with the development team to resolve a technical issue.
*   **End of Day:** Wrap up the day by sending out a status report to stakeholders and preparing for the next day's meetings.

## Your Transferable Skills

*   **Analytical Skills:** You're a natural problem-solver, and you know how to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts.
*   **Stakeholder Management Skills:** You know how to identify, analyze, and manage stakeholders to ensure their needs are met.
