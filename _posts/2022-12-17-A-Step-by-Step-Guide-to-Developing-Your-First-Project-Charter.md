# What is a Project Charter?

A project charter is a formal document that authorizes the start of a project and provides a high-level overview of the project's goals, objectives and parameters. It outlines the project scope, objectives, assumptions, risks, timelines, budget, and more. 

The project charter serves as a roadmap and a contract between the project sponsor, stakeholders and the project team. A well-written project charter establishes a foundation for project planning and helps align everyone's expectations and understanding of the project goals. It also serves as a reference document throughout the project's life cycle, ensuring everyone is on the same page and the project stays on track.


# Importance of Project Charter

The project charter serves as a communication tool for everyone involved in the project. It outlines the project's purpose, scope, and objectives, which helps align the project team and stakeholders. It also helps identify potential risks, challenges, and unknown factors that may impact the project's success. 

By defining the project's scope, objectives, timelines, budget, and team, the project charter provides a clear roadmap for project planning, execution, and delivery. It also serves as a reference document throughout the project’s life cycle, ensuring everyone is on the same page and the project stays on track.



# Key Elements of a Project Charter

To develop a comprehensive project charter, it is essential to include the following key elements:


## Executive Summary:
The executive summary is the first section of a project charter that provides a high-level overview of the project. It should include the project's objectives, key stakeholders, and timelines. It should also briefly mention the project's scope, costs, and benefits. The executive summary should be concise and provide the reader with an understanding of the project's purpose and significance.

## Project Objective:
The project objective defines the purpose and expected outcomes of the project. It should be a clear and concise statement that identifies the problem or opportunity the project aims to address. The objective should be measurable and specific, so it can be easily evaluated against the project's success criteria.

## Project Scope and Exclusion:
The project scope outlines the boundaries and limitations of the project. It should define what is included and excluded from the project. The scope should be clearly defined to avoid misunderstandings and scope creep. Scope creep is when the project's objectives and deliverables increase beyond the original scope, which can lead to increased costs and delays.

## Benefits & Costs:
The benefits and costs section outlines the expected benefits and costs of the project. It should describe how the project will add value to the organization and justify its cost. It should also identify any risks and assumptions that could impact the project's benefits and costs.

## Risks & Assumptions:
The risk and assumptions section should identify the potential risks and assumptions that could impact the project's success. Risks are uncertainties that could have a negative impact on the project, and assumptions are factors that are believed to be true but are not yet validated. Identifying risks and assumptions upfront helps to mitigate their impact and ensure the project's success.

## Measuring Success:
The measuring success section outlines the metrics and KPIs used to evaluate the project's success. It should identify the key performance indicators that will be used to measure progress and ensure the project is meeting its objectives. The metrics should be specific, measurable, and realistic.

## Project Timelines/ Milestones:
The project timeline outlines the key milestones and deliverables of the project. It should identify the key tasks and their estimated start and end dates. The timeline should be realistic and consider any potential delays or risks that could impact the project's timeline.

## Key stakeholders:
The key stakeholders section outlines the stakeholders involved in the project and their roles and responsibilities. It should identify who will be impacted by the project and who has a stake in its success. The stakeholders' interests should be considered when developing the project's objectives and scope.

Depending on the purpose and organizational practices, key elements can be changed. 

# How to Prepare a Project Charter
Now that you have an understanding of the importance of a project charter, let's dive into the steps to develop your first IT project charter.


Imagine you are a project manager tasked with implementing a new customer relationship management (CRM) system for your organization. You’ve been given a budget of $100,000 and a timeline of 6 months. Your project will involve the entire sales and marketing team, as well as IT and customer support. You need to create a project charter that clearly defines the project’s objectives, scope, and stakeholders, while also outlining the potential benefits, risks, and costs.


## Define the executive summary 
The executive summary is a brief overview of the project that provides context for the rest of the charter. It should include the project’s purpose, goals, and stakeholders. For your CRM project, your executive summary might read something like this:

“The purpose of this project is to implement a new customer relationship management system for our organization. The primary goal is to improve the customer experience by streamlining our sales and marketing processes. The project will involve the sales and marketing team, as well as IT and customer support. The expected outcome is increased customer satisfaction and retention.”

Since the executive summary convey the summarize message of the project for decision makers, it better to start writing this part after completing each section of the project charter. 

## Identify project objectives
The project objective defines what you hope to achieve through the project. It should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). For your CRM project, your objective might read:

The project objective is to implement a new CRM system that will improve our customer relationship management process. The CRM system will help us to better understand our customers' needs and improve customer retention rates. We aim to increase sales by 10% by the end of the year.



## Define Project Scope and Exclusion
The project scope outlines what is and is not included in the project. It helps to ensure that everyone on the project team understands the project’s boundaries. Meet with the project sponsor and stakeholders to clearly define the project's scope and boundaries. This will help to establish what is included and what is not included in the project. For your CRM project, your scope might read:


"The scope of the project includes the implementation of a new CRM system. The system will include features such as customer data management, lead tracking, and reporting. The exclusion of the project will be any custom development work that goes beyond the system's standard capabilities."

## Define Benefits and Costs
The benefits and costs section of the project charter outlines the potential benefits of the project and the associated costs. This section helps to ensure that the project is worth pursuing and provides a baseline for measuring success. For your CRM project

The benefits of the project include:

- Improved customer relationship management process
- Better understanding of customer needs
- Improved customer retention rates
- Increased sales by 10%

The costs of the project include:

- CRM system license fees - $50,000
- Hardware and infrastructure costs - $20,000
- Consulting and training fees - $20,000
- Project management and administration costs - $10,000

## Define Project Risk and Assumptions
The risk and assumptions section identifies potential risks to the project’s success and outlines any assumptions that have been made. This section helps to ensure that the project team is aware of potential challenges and can proactively address them. For your CRM project:

Risks:

- Delay in project timelines due to unforeseen circumstances
- Inadequate user adoption of the new system
- Integration issues with other systems
- Technical glitches and system downtime

Assumptions:

- Availability of required resources such as hardware, software, and human resources
- Adequate user training and support
- Smooth integration with existing systems

## Measuring Success of the Project 
The success of a project is measured by how well it meets the objectives and goals set out in the project charter. This is why it's crucial to define the success criteria in the charter. These criteria should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). 

For instance, the success of the project will be measured using the following KPIs:

- Customer retention rate
- Sales growth
- User adoption rate
- System uptime
- Project completion within budget and timeline

if the project objective is to increase sales by 20% in six months, then the success criteria could be achieving a 20% increase in sales by the end of the year.

## Project Timelines and Milestones
The project timeline is an essential part of the project charter. It outlines the key activities and milestones that must be achieved to deliver the project on time. The timeline should be created using a Gantt chart, which visually shows the project tasks, dependencies, and durations. It's also important to identify the critical path, which is the longest sequence of tasks that must be completed to deliver the project on time. For this instance, project Timelines and Milestones:

- Week 1-2: Project planning and stakeholder identification
- Week 3-4: System requirements gathering and vendor selection
- Week 5-6: System installation and configuration
- Week 7-8: User training and acceptance testing
- Week 9-10: System integration testing and data migration
- Week 11-12: System deployment and rollout



## Key Stakeholders
Identifying and engaging key stakeholders is critical to project success. A stakeholder is anyone who has an interest or is impacted by the project. This includes project sponsors, customers, team members, suppliers, regulators, and the community. The project charter should identify the key stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities in the project. It's also important to engage stakeholders throughout the project to ensure their expectations are managed and their concerns are addressed. For this project,

- Project sponsor: Provides funding and high-level support for the project
- Project manager: Manages the project and oversees project team members
- Sales and marketing team: Primary users of the CRM system
- IT team: Responsible for system installation, configuration, and maintenance
- Customer support team: Uses the CRM system to manage customer requests and complaints

During this step, you should also identify any training or development needs of the project team and develop a plan to address them.



# Best Practices for Preparing a Project Charter


Creating a successful project charter is critical to the success of any project. Here are some tips to keep in mind when creating a project charter:

## Involve key stakeholders:
It is essential to involve key stakeholders in the development of the project charter. By doing so, you can ensure that their interests and concerns are addressed in the charter.

## Be clear and concise: 
A project charter should be clear and concise, and it should not be too lengthy. A well-written charter should be easy to understand and should clearly outline the project’s objectives, scope, and timelines.

## Be SMART: 
Your project objectives should be SMART – specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. SMART objectives help ensure that everyone involved in the project is working towards the same goal.

## Define roles and responsibilities: 
The project charter should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each team member. This will help ensure that everyone understands their role in the project and can work together effectively.

## Keep it flexible: 
While a project charter provides a roadmap for the project, it is essential to keep it flexible. You may need to revise the charter as the project progresses to reflect changes in scope, timelines, and budgets.

## Use it as a reference: 
Use the project charter as a reference document throughout the project's life cycle, referring back to it frequently to ensure the project stays on track.

## Keep it updated: 
The project charter is a living document, and it should be updated regularly to reflect the project’s progress. This will help ensure that everyone involved in the project is aware of any changes and can adjust their work accordingly.

## Review and approve: 
Once the project charter is complete, it should be reviewed and approved by all key stakeholders. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the project’s goals, objectives, and scope.
